# Documentation

## Purpose
Point to existing documentation under `Documentation/` when present, without duplicating content in the wiki.

## Prereqs
- Access to `Documentation/` (not present in this repo snapshot).

## Steps
1. Obtain the `Documentation/` directory from the authoritative source or another branch.
2. Link key docs into this wiki to avoid duplication.
3. Summarize large documents and point to the source files.

## Verification
- Links resolve to the authoritative docs.
- Summaries remain aligned with the source documentation.

## Troubleshooting
- If the directory is missing, confirm whether docs were moved into README or another repo.
- If links break, update paths and references.

## References
- [README.md](../../README.md)
