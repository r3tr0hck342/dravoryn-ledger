# Scripts

## Purpose
Describe operational scripts expected under a `Scripts/` directory when present.

## Prereqs
- Access to `Scripts/` (not present in this repo snapshot).
- Execution permissions for the scripts.

## Steps
1. Obtain the `Scripts/` directory from the authoritative source or another branch.
2. Review script headers for usage instructions.
3. Run scripts in a staging environment before production.

## Verification
- Scripts complete without errors and produce expected artifacts.

## Troubleshooting
- If the directory is missing, check for renamed or relocated script folders.
- If a script fails, validate environment variables and dependencies.
