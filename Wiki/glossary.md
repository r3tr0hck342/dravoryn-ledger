# Glossary

## Purpose
Define shared terms used throughout this wiki and related operations.

## Prereqs
- Basic familiarity with infrastructure automation concepts.

## Steps
Use the list below as a quick reference.

### Terms
- **Controller**: The system (often a workstation or CI runner) that initiates automation tasks and runs orchestration tooling.
- **Target hosts**: The servers or devices being configured or operated on by automation tooling.
- **Inventory groups**: Named collections of target hosts used to scope automation runs.
- **CASCORE / SASCORE**: Environment- or role-specific group labels used to distinguish host classes (definitions should be aligned with your internal naming). These appear in the requested documentation areas but are not present in this repo snapshot.

## Verification
- Terms here should match any terminology used in README or future infrastructure folders added to the repo.

## Troubleshooting
- If a term is used in new files and is missing here, add a definition and link to the source.

## References
- [README.md](../README.md)
