# Repo Map

## Purpose
Explain the purpose of each top-level directory and file so readers can quickly orient themselves.

## Prereqs
- Read the [README](../README.md) for project intent and usage context.

## Steps
1. Review the top-level layout below.
2. Follow links for deeper context.

### Top-level layout (current tree)
- `README.md`: High-level overview and entry point for the repository.
- `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata and tooling configuration.
- `src/`: Source code for the application/library.
- `tests/`: Automated test suite.
- `examples/`: Example inputs/outputs and reference artifacts.
- `.git/`: Git metadata (not typically referenced directly).

### Requested areas (not present in this repo snapshot)
The following areas were requested for coverage but are **not present** in the current repo tree. Placeholder pages exist in this wiki to capture expected usage and to link back once those directories are added:
- `ansible-offline-install-stuff/`
- `offline_ssh_setup/`
- `caerus-ansible/`
- `Scripts/`
- `bash-scripts/`
- `molecule/`
- `Documentation/`

## Verification
- Confirm links above resolve and the directory list matches the repository root.

## Troubleshooting
- If a directory is missing, check for branches or submodules not present in this checkout.
- If the repo layout changes, update this page and the area placeholders accordingly.
